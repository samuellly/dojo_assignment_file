          <h2> JavaScript Basics</h2>
          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.
            It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
           JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

            <ul>
              <li><a href="www.google.com">Variable Declaration</a>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.
                All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called indentifers. <em>var x;</em></li>
              <li><a href="www.google.com/">Variable Assignment</a>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee pour in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <em>var x = 10;</em></li>
              <li><a href="www.google.com/">Data Types</a>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
                There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <em>true</em> or <em>false;</em> null - <em>null</em>aka nothing; Number<em>-42</em>or <em>3.14159;</em>String -<em>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</em> Array -<em>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</em> and Object -<em>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</em></li>
              <li><a href="www.google.com/">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.
                There are the folowing conditional statements: <em>if</em> a specificed condition is true, do this code in our code block; <em>else if</em> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <em>else</em> we execute this block of code;</li>
              <li><a href="www.google.com/">Loops</a>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing; they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
              <li><a href="www.google.com/">Function</a>Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.<p></li>
